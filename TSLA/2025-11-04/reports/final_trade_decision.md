Recommendation: BUY, with disciplined risk controls and monitoring.

1. Key Arguments Summarized  
   • Risky Analyst (Bull)  
     – “Tesla just delivered 11.6 percent revenue growth to $95.6 billion … still the innovation leader in EVs and autonomy.”  
     – Technicals: “stock sits above its 50- and 200-day averages, MACD momentum is healthy.”  
     – Optionality: robotaxi platform, FSD subscriptions, energy business.  
     – Tariff easing gives cost advantage on exports.  
   • Safe Analyst (Bear)  
     – “10 percent drop in China sales suggests serious challenge … margin pressure is real if Tesla chases market share with lower-priced models.”  
     – Profit margins only ~5.3 percent; high R&D spending may not yield immediate returns.  
     – Governance risk: “Musk’s controversial decisions could alienate investors.”  
     – Macro headwinds: high interest rates, volatile consumer demand.  
   • Neutral Analyst  
     – Agrees growth and innovation are real but stresses “high expenditures in R&D need to yield tangible results.”  
     – “Elon Musk’s leadership … can lead to increased volatility and uncertainty.”  
     – Recommends balanced exposure with “robust risk management—staggered entries, position sizing, hedging.”

2. Rationale  
   – Long-run moat vs. near-term noise: Tesla’s scale, vertical integration and tech edge afford it a leading position despite intensifying competition in China.  
   – Financials: 11.6 percent top-line growth and sustained profitability underpin upside; low margins underscore need for cost discipline and execution.  
   – Technicals favor continuation: trading above key moving averages; RSI ~60—not yet overbought.  
   – Headwinds real—but mitigatable: margin pressure, China slowdown and governance risk argue for a measured build rather than an all-in at once.  

3. Lessons from Past Mistakes  
   – We’ve previously held through macro tightenings without hedges; this time we’ll pre-set protective options.  
   – Last cycle we let positions run beyond our targets; now we’ll scale out at predefined profit tiers.  
   – We underestimated incremental China weakness; hence we’ll tie tranche entries to regional sales data.  

4. Refined Trading Plan  
   A. Position Sizing  
      – Total allocation: 5 percent of equity portfolio.  
      – Tranches: three equal pieces (~1.67 percent each).  
   B. Entry Triggers  
      1. Tranche 1: Immediate at current levels.  
      2. Tranche 2: On pullback to the 50-day MA (~$255).  
      3. Tranche 3: On deeper pullback to the 200-day MA (~$230) or if China
