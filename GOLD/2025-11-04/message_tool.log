23:06:14 [Reasoning] It seems there is no available stock data for the symbol "GOLD" for the specified periods. This could be due to various reasons, such as the symbol being incorrectly input, the stock not being listed on the exchanges during this timeframe, or it being a commodity rather than a stock.  If you're looking for insights on gold as a commodity, typically, this would involve looking at broader market trends, including economic indicators, interest rates, geopolitical factors, and demand/supply dynamics.  If you're interested in a specific trading strategy or analysis related to gold, please let me know how you'd like to proceed or if there's another symbol you'd like to analyze!
